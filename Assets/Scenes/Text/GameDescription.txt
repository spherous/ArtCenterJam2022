Alone in the Park is a game about finding peace, love, and joy where you can while struggling with the fear, anger and sadness.  Inspired by the experiences of some of creators of the game you play as a homeless woman wrestling with her emotions as she tries to make her way though the darkness of spending the night in the park.  Places of rest recharge her positive emotions while things that go bump in the night are lurking around every corner draining her emotional reserves.
